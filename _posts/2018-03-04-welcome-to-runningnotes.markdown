## Hello, This is Mahipal.

I am from Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, India. 

I worked as Aerospace Engineer Validating the Hardware Functionality of Radio/Recorder/Display Products and was supporting Manufacturing floor. I later worked on developing prototyes in wearable segment and validating usecases. I have Private Pilot Licence for Cesna172R from DGCA to help build better functionalities in my work line. It was sponsored program on 3 yr Bond. I fulfilled it and filed 6 ideas at Patent office after. 

I was in very bad depression for sometime and finally took a break on 2016 June. I Quit. Came Hometown and was here ever since and went broke.

I think, i finally started coming out of Depression and i am feeling better since early 2018.

I started learning/started socializing(not as good), i am feeling much better, not as jovial/healthy as in 2013, just yet. I believe i will enventually get there.

My Skills from Previous life include, Aerospace Domain Knowledge, Labwindows/CVI, some propreitory Automation Tools, Automated Test Equipments, Hardware Validation.

Definitely not a Geek. All the coding was in C language (well mostly, others were bit of java, Visual Basic) and at a level between 3-5 on scale of 10 (coz there was never need to code beyond or anything complex), remaining part was unwareness/laziness.

Now, Coming to the present time: Mobile and Web are some platforms i developed some interest for a while, and now 
that i have started learning, should help me strategically too.

I started with Java and Android Platform, at the moment, and very much into initial stages.

I had some difficulty and lil confusion when following few resources, though there are multiple Great content/blogs available. I felt i should share information that i learnt which should help atleast few and inturn help myself. I though i should publish my learnings covering the information that i felt needed for myself/like minded.

I never Wrote. I never Lectured. (well apart from some presentation/some explanation to new joinees). So, i am hoping to get better at it.

My Blog features maynot be topnotch, but servers purpose.

We all have the habit of maintaining running notes in the class room, so i felt this name should be apt, so www.runningnotes.info is named.

I am here to make friends too. So, dont forget to Say "Hi"
